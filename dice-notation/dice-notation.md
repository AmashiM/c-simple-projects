# Process

### Storing Values
- Need a cache for different tokens that we'll organize stuff into.
- Need a way to track multiple variables that're closely related to


### 1. Parse Text

we'll need to first measure how long our text is.
```c
size_t length;
```

### 2. Organize Into Cache

### 3. Define Keep

### 4. Define Dice

### 5. Define Groups
this step is essential before we process our tokens to produce a result.


### 6. Process Dice Notation
